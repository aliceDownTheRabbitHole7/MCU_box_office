First, I crunched the numbers to find out the average box office revenues, ratings, and budgets for each MCU movie. Then, I dove into the performance of each phase of the franchise. After that, I took those average scores I found earlier and checked out how movies above the average score compared the ones below it. Finally, I compared how movies with a bigger-than-average budget performed compared to those with a smaller budget.

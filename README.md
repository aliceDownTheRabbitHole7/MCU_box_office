I started by calculating the average box office revenues, ratings, and budgets for each Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movie. Then, I looked into how each phase of the franchise performed. After that, I compared movies that scored above average with those that scored below. Finally, I examined how movies with bigger budgets did compared to those with smaller budgets.
